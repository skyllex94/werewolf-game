        <Text className="text-sm text-white mb-4">
          Werewolf: Save the Village will store user-related game data within
          the appâ€™s data storage. The data is not visible and not transferable
          outside the app itself. Any saving to the local system is the
          responsibility of the customer and should be taken with the risk of
          data potentially leaking outside the intended scope. Customers may
          retrieve and store copies of game-related data outside of the system
          at any time during the term of their service plan, and may delete or
          purge game data from the system at their discretion. Werewolf: Save
          the Village assumes no liability for any failure or inability to use
          game features or data. Transaction data associated with gameplay and
          any in-app purchases will be retained within the app and is not
          transferable by switching mobile devices.

        <Text className="text-sm text-white mb-4">
          You may receive or be eligible for certain pricing structures,
          discounts, features, promotions, and other benefits (collectively,
          "Benefits") through a business or government customer's agreement with
          us (a "Business Agreement"). Any and all such Benefits are provided to
          you solely as a result of the corresponding Business Agreement, and
          such Benefits may be modified or terminated without notice. If you use
          the Werewolf game services where a business or government entity pays
          your charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us
          to share your account information with that entity and/or its
          authorized agents. If you are enrolled in a service plan or receive
          certain benefits tied to a Business Agreement but are responsible for
          your own charges, you authorize us to share enough account information
          with that entity to verify your continuing eligibility for those
          benefits.

          standard service plan charges will be billed in arrears. You must
          promptly notify us of any change in your invoicing address or changes
          related to the payment method used. By completing your registration
          for the service plan, you authorize Werewolf: Save the Village or its
          agent to charge your payment method for the applicable service plan
          charges, taxes, and other charges you may incur in connection with
