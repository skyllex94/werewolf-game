      description="The Doctor is a critical role in protecting the Village from nightly attacks. Each night, the Doctor selects one player to shield from harm, potentially preventing a Werewolf attack or other fatal outcome. This makes the Doctor a valuable asset to the Village's defense, as their protection can help keep key players safe and prolong the fight against the Werewolves. However, the Doctor's ability comes with a risk; if the Doctor is eliminated, their protective influence vanishes entirely. Losing the Doctor puts the Village at greater risk, making it essential to protect this role as long as possible. The Doctor must balance caution and courage, working discreetly to avoid detection by the Werewolves while ensuring the Villageâ€™s survival. The Doctor can use his protection on one player and cannot repeat a player for the next round. He can go back to protecting the same player after a night has passed again. The Doctor can use his protection on himself as well."

        "Cupid - If the Doctor protects one of the bonded players and the Werewolves attempt to kill them, the protection will prevent both players from dying that night.",
